## Comparisons with Other Hacks

While aimbot helps you in fights and wallhack exposes campers, ESP is the **king of awareness**. In Sea of Thieves, where treasure and ship positioning are everything, ESP offers unique advantages not found in shooters like Warzone or Fortnite. Treasure ESP alone gives you a head start every session, making it one of the most popular hacks for SoT.
